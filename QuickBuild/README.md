# QuickBuild

The `build` script on terminals requires you to pass absolute paths of where you want to compile a source to.
QuickBuild is meant to just compile the source into the current working directory.
This allows you to just use `qb some_file.src` and build the file right where you are, without having to type out the entire path again.
